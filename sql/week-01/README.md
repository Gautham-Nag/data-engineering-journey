# Week 01 – SQL Foundations (Pharma Use Case)

This week focuses on building strong SQL fundamentals using a realistic
online pharmacy domain.

## What I worked on
- Designed a relational database schema
- Created core transactional tables
- Practiced real-world SQL queries
- Observed common SQL edge cases and errors

## Files in this folder
- `schema_design.md` – Database & table design decisions
- `core_queries.sql` – Common SELECT, DELETE, ORDER BY queries
- `edge_cases.md` – Precision, date validation, escaping, access control

## Key takeaways
- Schema design impacts data quality and query performance
- SQL errors often reveal incorrect assumptions
- Edge cases matter as much as happy paths

This is part of my structured journey to master Data Engineering.
