# Week 02 – Relational Modeling & Data Integrity

This week focuses on moving beyond basic SQL queries into
**relational database design, constraints, and data integrity**.

The goal was to understand how real-world systems enforce correctness,
not just how to retrieve data.

## What I worked on
- Designed a multi-table healthcare schema
- Implemented primary keys and foreign keys
- Used CHECK, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL constraints
- Practiced schema evolution using ALTER statements
- Analyzed cascading effects of deletes
- Wrote analytical queries on transactional data

## Key concepts reinforced
- Constraints protect data quality at the database level
- Foreign keys model real-world relationships
- Cascading deletes must be used carefully
- Data type choices affect correctness and precision
- SQL errors often expose incorrect assumptions

## Outcome
This week helped me think like a **data engineer**, not just a SQL user:
designing schemas that prevent bad data rather than fixing it later.
